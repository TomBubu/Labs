# Labs

1. Create github rep for my labs
2. Clients tab: 
		- Save accounts to client file
		- Load a particular client file when client logs in
		- Load all client files when bank employee logs in
			- Update: Employee will load list of all clients. Then he/she will search for a client. We can load a particular client file in that moment because the first name and surname will be specified and it will make it easier for us. 

3. Transactions tab: 
			- Log deposit and withdrawal transactions in the GUI
			- Save these transactions to customer file
			- Load these transactions from the customer file
